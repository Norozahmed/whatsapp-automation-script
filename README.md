## Overview
The WhatsApp Automation Script is a Python-based tool that leverages the `pywhatkit` library to send WhatsApp messages programmatically. It provides a user-friendly GUI built with `tkinter`, allowing users to schedule messages, send images, and manage configurations easily.

## Features
- **GUI Interface**: A simple and intuitive graphical interface for easy interaction.
- **Scheduled Messaging**: Allows users to schedule messages to be sent at a specific time.
- **Image Attachment**: Supports sending images along with a caption.
- **Group Messaging**: Option to send messages to WhatsApp groups (Note: Instant group messaging not supported).
- **Log Console**: Displays real-time logs of script activity, including sent messages and errors.
- **Configuration Options**:
    - Option to close the browser tab after sending a message.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling to manage issues gracefully and inform the user.

## Requirements
Before running the script, ensure you have the following:
- **Python**: Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.
- **pywhatkit**: A Python library for interacting with WhatsApp Web.
- **tkinter**: Python's standard GUI library (usually included with Python).

### Dependencies Installation

Install the required libraries using pip:


For `tkinter`, it's usually included with Python. If not, install it using:

- **Ubuntu/Debian**:
- **Windows**: Ensure you select "tcl/tk" during Python installation.
- **macOS**:


## Installation
1.  **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a GitHub repository, clone it to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd [repository_directory]
    ```
2.  **Download the Script**: Alternatively, download the `wt_message.py` file directly to your local machine.

## Usage
1.  **Open WhatsApp Web**: Make sure you have WhatsApp Web open and logged in on your default web browser.
2.  **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script:
    ```
    python wt_message.py
    ```
3.  **Interact with the GUI**:
    - **Recipient/Group ID**: Enter the recipient's phone number (with country code, e.g., "+1234567890") or the group ID.
    - **Message**: Type the message you want to send.
    - **Schedule Time (HH:MM)**: Enter the time you want to schedule the message (in 24-hour format, e.g., "14:30" for 2:30 PM).
    - **Image Path**: Click "Browse" to select an image to send with the message.
    - **Send to Group**: Check this box if you're sending to a group.
    - **Close Tab After Sending**: Check this box to automatically close the WhatsApp Web tab after the message is sent.
    - **Schedule Message**: Click to schedule the message.
    - **Send Now**: Click to send the message immediately.

## Code Explanation
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the main parts of the script:

### Imports
- **tkinter**: For creating the GUI.
- **ttk**: For modern tkinter widgets.
- **messagebox**: For displaying dialog boxes.
- **filedialog**: For browsing files.
- **pywhatkit**: For sending WhatsApp messages.
- **threading**: For running tasks in the background.
- **datetime**: For handling time-related operations.
- **Queue**: For thread-safe communication.

### WhatsAppAutomationApp Class
- **`__init__`**: Initializes the main application window, sets up configurations, and creates widgets.
- **`create_widgets`**: Creates all the GUI elements, such as labels, entry fields, buttons, and the log console.
- **`browse_image`**: Opens a file dialog to select an image.
- **`validate_inputs`**: Validates user inputs, such as phone number format and schedule time.
- **`schedule_message`**: Schedules the message to be sent using a background thread.
- **`send_message_threadsafe_wrapper`**: Sends the WhatsApp message in a thread-safe manner.
- **`send_immediately`**: Sends the message immediately in a background thread.
- **`log`**: Adds a message to the log queue.
- **`check_log_queue`**: Checks the log queue and updates the log console.

### Thread-Safe Operations
To prevent Tkinter-related errors, all GUI updates are performed on the main thread using a queue (`log_queue`) and the `check_log_queue` method. This ensures that Tkinter operations are thread-safe.

### Main Execution
This part creates the Tkinter window and starts the application.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues while running the script, consider the following:
- **Incorrect Phone Number Format**: Make sure the phone number is in the correct international format (e.g., +1234567890).
- **WhatsApp Web Login**: Ensure you are logged into WhatsApp Web on your browser.
- **Time Zone**: The script uses your system's time zone. Ensure your system time is set correctly.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Use a compatible browser (Chrome, Firefox) for WhatsApp Web.
- **Dependencies**: Make sure all required libraries are installed.
- **Permissions**: Ensure the script has the necessary permissions to access the image file.

### Common Errors and Solutions
- **`RuntimeError: main thread is not in main loop`**: This error occurs when Tkinter operations are performed outside the main thread. The provided code includes a fix using a queue (`log_queue`) to ensure all GUI updates are thread-safe.
- **Images not sending**: Ensure the image path is correct, and the script has permissions to access the image file.
